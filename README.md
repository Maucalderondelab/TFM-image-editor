## Creating an image editor combining GroundingDino + SAM + Stable Diffusion
### Context 
In the era of Big Data, Data Science (DS), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), extracting knowledge and creativity has become a fundamental discipline, especially in image editing, which plays a crucial role in multiple areas like graphic design, advertising, marketing, and entertainment. However, manual editing can be tedious and time-consuming.

To address this problem, there is a need for automated tools that can facilitate and optimize the editing process. There have been incredible advances in AI, particularly in the field of generative models, presenting a unique opportunity to develop automatic image editors capable of performing complex tasks with greater efficiency and precision.

With the emergence of technologies such as Text-to-Image (TTI), segmentation models, and generative AI, different tools have shown remarkable performance in various tasks. Combining these technologies can pave the way for creating innovative tools that benefit everyone.
